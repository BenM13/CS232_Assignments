Position of command line arguments:

Although the documentation instructs the user to call the script with arguments in a certain position,
the truth, is position does not matter. The following two script calls will actually yield the same result:
    java NewQuery 101x/FL17 --opt_in
    java NewQuery --opt_in 101x/FL17
-------------------------------------------

Number of dashes:

The use of dashes in the command line arguments was modeled after Git's CLI.
One dash is used for a flag's short-hand, while two dashes spell out the full name of the flag
(ex: -h and --help). However, because the number of dashes in arguments is not standard across
CLI programs, this script was designed so that the number of dashes does not matter. As long as there is 
at least one dash at the beggining of an argument, the program will know that it is a flag:
    --help, -help, -------help will all call the help function if used. 
-------------------------------------------

Contradicting flags:

Several columns in the database tables are booleans. These are attributes such as paid, completed, or viewed. 
The student either viewed a course, or did not view a course. This is a command line utility; there is no interaction
with the user. Therefore there is nothing to prevent a user from asking for a list of all students who viewed a course
AND did not view a course. If this were to happen, the query would run successfully but would not produce any results. 
For a single course, it's not possible to have both viewed AND not viewed the course. Such a query would always return 
false. As a result, the program will accept the query and run it, but will produce a warning message in the event that
the results are empty. For example, if I run the following query asking for all students of 101x/FL17 who have viewed 
and not viewed the course the following will be printed to the console:
```
12/11/2018 14:19:26 - Connection established.
12/11/2018 14:19:26 - Executing query...
12/11/2018 14:19:26 - WARNING: Query yielded no results
        Command line arguments may be incorrect
12/11/2018 14:19:26 - Connection closed.
```
Note that this is a warning message as opposed to an error. It is possible that there are no results returned even if
the command line arguments are correct. Perhaps no one passed that particular course.
