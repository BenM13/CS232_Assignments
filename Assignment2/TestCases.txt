Bad cases:

in parseLastName()
    This method takes a substring of the input so that
    only the first letter entered is accpeted.
    Even if the user enters junk, it will still accept it and
    compare the first letter to the regular expression.
    HOWEVER, if the user does not provide any input and just 
    hits enter, the program will take that in as a blank string 
    and will throw StringIndexOutOfBoundsException

in checkDouble() and checkInt()
    These methods check any numerical input to make sure they are
    actually numbers. Although there is a try-catch statement, this will
    simply catch the error and print out a nice a more cohesive error message
    and call the quitProgram() method. In other words, if the user types in
    anything other than a number, Java will through a NumberFormatException
    but instead of crashing, it will exit the program via quitProgram()

in inputTaxStatus()
    This method will only except integers. Exceptions will not be caught.
    If the user enters anything other than an integer, the program will crash 
    and Java will throw InputMismatchException.
