    private void quitProgram()
    {
        print some exit message
        System.exit(0);

    public void parseFirstName()
    {
        print intructions
        prompt for input
        if input equals exit condition
            quitProgram()

            repeat this method!
    }

    public void parseLastName()
    {
        print instructions
        make an empty string
        prompt for input
        only take first letter of input
        use a period as stop condition for last name loop
        while input does not equal period (.)
            if input equals program's exit condition
                quitProgram();
            else if input matches regex
                add letter to empty string
            else
                print error message
                repeat this method!
        last name = name collected so far 
    }
    
    private int/double check number
    {
        this function will check each numnber input
        for validity. Numbers will always be inputed as a string
        then we'll try to convert it
        if input equals program stop condition
            quitProgram()
        else  
            use a try catch
            try to convert input to int or double
            catch exception
                print an error message
                exit the program
        return int or double
    }

NOTE ON CHECK NUMBER:
If the user inputs something other than a number, the program will close
but it will not crash like with the usual Java Exception message.  Instead it will print out an
error message and inform the user that the program is exiting and say why. In the future
I hope to be able to keep programs running and simply reprompt the user for input,
but I'm quickly discovering that try catch in Java is not as simple as try except in Python

    public void get expense input
    {
        prompt user for each variables
        take input and pass it to check number method
    }

    access methods
    {
        all instance variables are private
        I'll use access methods here to pass use them
        in the main method.
